## by Ahmed Aldawody

## Dataset

> This document explores a dataset containing Divvy's bike trip data "Chicago, IL" of the year 2020, It contains about 3541683 rows and 13 columns.

> Data downloaded from https://www.divvybikes.com/system-data.


## Summary of Findings

> I extended my investigation of duration against time in terms of month, week day and day part by looking at the impact of is_member and rideable_type features. The multivariate exploration here showed that duration increases in cases when the user is not a member and the bike used is of a docked type especially at night, weekens and summer.

> Finding out that classic bikes used only in December and no other type but docked used from January to June was sort of a surprise.

## Key Insights for Presentation
